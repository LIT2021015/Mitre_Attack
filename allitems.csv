CVE-1999-0001,Candidate,"ip_input.c in BSD-derived TCP/IP implementations allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or hang) via crafted packets.","BUGTRAQ:19981223 Re: CERT Advisory CA-98.13 - TCP/IP Denial of Service   |   CERT:CA-98-13-tcp-denial-of-service   |   CONFIRM:http://www.openbsd.org/errata23.html#tcpfix   |   OSVDB:5707   |   URL:http://www.osvdb.org/5707",Modified (20051217),"   MODIFY(1) Frech  |     NOOP(2) Northcutt, Wall  |     REVIEWING(1) Christey","Christey> A Bugtraq posting indicates that the bug has to do with  |    ""short packets with certain options set,"" so the description  |    should be modified accordingly.  |      |    But is this the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related  |    to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in  |    BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release  |    The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.  |    The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.

See  |    http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html  |      |    Significant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail  |    list.  The fundamental question appears to be whether   |    application software should set its own limits, or rely  |    on limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,  |    UNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that  |    the suggested configuration was not well documented, but this  |    was refuted by others.  |      |    See the following threads at  |    http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html  |    ""Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)""  |    ""qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service""  |    ""[PATCH] denial of service""  |    ""just another qmail denial-of-service""  |    ""the UNIX way""  |    ""Time for a reality check""  |      |    Also see Bugtraq threads on a different vulnerability that  |    is related to this topic:  |    BUGTRAQ:19990903 Web servers / possible DOS Attack / mime header flooding  |    http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/1998_3/0742.html  |    Baker> http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html  |    Berstein rejects this as a vulnerability, claiming this is a slander campaign by Wietse Venema.  |    His page states this is not a qmail problem, rather it is a UNIX problem  |    that many apps can consume all available memory, and that the administrator  |    is responsible to set limits in the OS, rather than expect applications to  |    individually prevent memory exhaustion.

It is simply a large ICMP echo request.  |    Christey> See the SCO advisory at:  |    http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/advisory.html?id=1411  |    which may further clarify the issue.  |    LeBlanc> This is a hodge-podge of DoS attacks. Jolt isn't the same  |    thing as ping of death - POD was an oversized ICMP packet, Jolt froze  |    Linux and Solaris (and I think not NT), IIRC Jolt2 did get NT boxes.  |    Teardrop and teardrop2 were related attacks (usually ICMP frag attacks),  |    but each of these is a distinct vulnerability, affected a discrete group  |    of systems, and should have distinct CVE numbers. CVE entries should be  |    precise as to what the problem is.  |    Meunier> I agree with Leblanc in that Jolt is multi-faceted.  Jolt has  |    characteristics of Ping of Death AND teardrop, but it doesn't do  |    either exactly.  Moreover, it sends a truncated IP fragment.  I  |    disagree with Armstrong; jolt uses overlapping fragments.  It's not a  |    simple ping of death either.  It may be that the author's intent was  |    to construct a ""super attack"" somehow combining elements of other  |    vulnerabilities to try to make it more potent.  In any case it  |    succeeded in confusing the CVE board :-).  |      |    I notice that Jolt uses echo replies (type 0) instead of echo  |    requests (to get past firewalls?).  Jolt is peculiar in that it also  |    sends numerous overlapping fragments.  The ""Pascal Simulator"" :-) says  |    it sends:  |      |    - 172 fragments of length 400 with offset starting at 5120 and  |    increasing by about 47 (odd arithmetic of 5120 OR ((n* 380) > > 3)),  |    which eventually results in sending fragments inside an already  |    covered area once ((n* 380) > > 3) is greater than 5120, which occurs  |    when n is reaches 108.  This would look a bit like TearDrop if  |    fragments were reassembled on-the-fly.  |      |    - 1 fragment such that the total length of all the fragments  |    is greater than 65535 (my calculation is 172*380 + 418 = 65778; the  |    comment about 65538 must be wrong).  The last packet is size 418  |    according to the IP header but the buffer is of size 400.  The sendto  |    takes as argument the size of the buffer so a truncated packet is  |    sent.  |      |    So, I am not sure if the problem is because the last packet  |    doesn't extend to the payload it says it has or because the total size  |    of all fragments is greater than 65535.  The author says it may take  |    more than one sending, so perhaps this has to do with an incorrect  |    error handling and recovery.  One would need to experiment and isolate  |    each of those characteristics and test them independently.  Inasmuch  |    as each of those things is likely a different vulnerability, then I  |    agree with Leblanc that this entry should be split.  I'll try that if  |    I ever get bored.  Jolt 2 should also have a different entry (see  |    below).  |      |    Jolt 2 runs in an infinite loop, sending the same fragmented  |    IP packet, which can pretend to be ""ICMP"" or ""UDP"" data; however this  |    is meaningless, as it's just a late fragment of an IP packet.  The  |    attack works only as long as packets are sent.  According to  |    http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/62170 the packets are  |    truncated, and would overflow over the 65535 byte limit, which is  |    similar to Jolt.  Note that Jolt does send that much data whereas  |    jolt2 doesn't.  Since jolt2 is simpler and narrower than jolt, and it  |    has weaker consequences, I believe that it's a different  |    vulnerability.  |      |    ""Jolt 2 vulnerability causes a temporary denial-of-service in  |    Windows-type OSes"" would be a title for it."

The procedural  |    differences between the individual exploits for each of these utilities  |    are therefore inconsequential. CVE-1999-0988 should be merged with  |    CVE-1999-0828. From the standpoint of maintaining consistency of the  |    level of abstraction used in CVE, the co-existence of CANS  |    1999-0988/1999-0828 present two choices: either merge 0988 with 0828, or  |    split 0828 into 4 distinct candidates, keeping 0988 intact. Due to the  |    very small differences (in principle) between the exploits subsumed by  |    0828 and 0988 and the shared dacread permissions of the pkg* suite, I  |    suggest a merge. Below is a summary of the data upon which my decision  |    was based.  |    utility         exploit  |    --------      ----------------------------------   |    pkgtrans  --> symlink + dacread permission prob  |    pkginfo   --> truss (debugging utility) in conjunction with pkginfio -d  |    etc/shadow. In this case, it captures the interaction between  |    pkginfo                the shadow file. Once again: dacread.  |    pkgcat    --> buffer overflow  + dacread permission prob  |    pkginstall -> buffer overflow + dacread permission prob  |    pkgparam --> -f etc/shadow (works because of dacread).  |    Christey> This is a tough one.  While there are few procedural  |    differences, one could view ""assignment of an improper  |    permission"" as a ""class"" of problems along the lines of  |    buffer overflows and the like.  Just like some programs  |    were fine until they got turned into CGI scripts, this  |    could be an emerging pattern which should be given  |    consideration.
